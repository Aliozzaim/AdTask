## Description

AdRespectTask is designed to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly experience for exploring and interacting with images. Whether you want to browse a curated collection of images or search for specific ones, this application makes it easy to do so. Key features include:

- **Responsive Image Gallery**: The gallery is laid out using the Masonry layout, ensuring that images fit neatly even on different screen sizes.

- **Image Modal**: Clicking on an image opens a modal, allowing users to view the image in detail. They can navigate through multiple images using left and right arrows or slideshow indicators.

- **Slideshow**: Users can enjoy a hands-free viewing experience with the slideshow feature, automatically transitioning between images.

- **Expand Gallery**: To offer more content, the "Expand" button loads additional images into the gallery, expanding the user's browsing options.

- **Search Functionality**: The search bar enables users to find specific images by entering keywords, making image discovery more convenient.

This project is an excellent starting point for building image-focused web applications and can be customized and extended as needed.
